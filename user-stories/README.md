# User Stories Directory

This directory contains documented user stories based on the use case diagram of the ALX Airbnb Clone project.

Each user story describes a core interaction between users and the system from the userâ€™s point of view.

These stories help guide the design, development, and testing of the platform by focusing on user needs and goals.
